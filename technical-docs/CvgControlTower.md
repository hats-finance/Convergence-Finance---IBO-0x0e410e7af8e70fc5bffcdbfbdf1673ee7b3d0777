# CvgControlTower

## Description

This contract aims to be the heart of Convergence. Every other contract deployed by us will take data from it.
It contains all the needed information for the protocol to run smoothly: staking data, locking data and more...

This is an upgradeable contract so we have the ability to implement new data and functionalities in the future in case we would like to upgrade to a V2.
